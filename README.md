# Guess The Flag

Guess The Flag is a simple iOS game built using SwiftUI where players are presented with three flags of different countries and have to guess the correct one based on the country name provided. The game tracks the player's score and presents feedback for each guess.

## Credits

This project is part of the ["100 Days of SwiftUI" course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by Paul Hudson. I learned how to build this game and further develop my SwiftUI skills through the course.

## Learning Experience

In addition to following the main project instructions, I completed extra challenges provided at the end of the course where there were no instructions.
